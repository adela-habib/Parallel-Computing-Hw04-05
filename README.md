4/13/2018
Gen:  added global variables
      ...and other stuff
      not sure what to say :D
4/15/2018
All:  added run_simulation(), sim_tick(), and pthread_id0()
      joint effort & team work <3
4/16/2018
Gen:  altered if/else statements in run_simulation code (line 291) to account for when there is only one pthread
      moved pthread-joining to inside the if (number of pthreads > 0) statement (main function), previously was outside if/else
      added "additional randomness" aspect - line 242.
